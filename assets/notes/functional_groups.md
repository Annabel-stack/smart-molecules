# Functional Groups

Functional groups are specific groups of atoms within molecules that determine the characteristics of those molecules.

**Examples:**
- **Alkanes:** Single bonds only (e.g., CH₄, C₂H₆)
- **Alkenes:** At least one double bond (e.g., C₂H₄)
- **Alkynes:** At least one triple bond (e.g., C₂H₂)
- **Alcohols:** Contain -OH group (e.g., CH₃OH)
- **Esters:** Contain -COO- group (e.g., CH₃COOCH₃)

Functional groups help classify and name organic compounds.
