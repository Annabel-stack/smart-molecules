# Isomerism in Organic Chemistry

**Isomers** are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures or arrangements of atoms.

## Types of Isomerism:

### 1. **Structural Isomerism**
Atoms are connected differently.
- **Chain isomerism** – different carbon chain arrangement  
  e.g., butane vs. methylpropane
- **Position isomerism** – functional group in different positions  
  e.g., 1-butanol vs. 2-butanol
- **Functional group isomerism** – different functional groups  
  e.g., ethanol (alcohol) vs. dimethyl ether (ether)

### 2. **Stereoisomerism**
Atoms are connected the same way but differ in spatial arrangement.
- **Geometric (cis-trans) isomerism** – in alkenes  
  e.g., cis-but-2-ene vs. trans-but-2-ene
- **Optical isomerism** – molecules that are mirror images (chiral)

## Importance:
Isomers often have **different physical and chemical properties**.
