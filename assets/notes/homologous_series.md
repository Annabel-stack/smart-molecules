# Homologous Series in Organic Chemistry

A **homologous series** is a group of organic compounds with the same functional group and general formula, where each member differs by a CH₂ unit.

## Characteristics:
- Same functional group
- Same general formula
- Gradation in physical properties (e.g., boiling point increases with size)
- Similar chemical properties

## Examples of Homologous Series:

| Series | General Formula | Examples            |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| Alkanes | CnH2n+2         | Methane (CH₄), Ethane (C₂H₆) |
| Alkenes | CnH2n           | Ethene (C₂H₄), Propene (C₃H₆) |
| Alkynes | CnH2n-2         | Ethyne (C₂H₂), Butyne (C₄H₆) |
| Alcohols | CnH2n+1OH      | Methanol (CH₃OH), Ethanol (C₂H₅OH) |
| Carboxylic Acids | CnH2nO₂ | Methanoic acid, Ethanoic acid |

## Importance:
Homologous series make it easier to **predict properties and reactions** of organic compounds.
